                  <p className="mb-2">
                    Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of identifying a real-world problem and developing an innovative,
                    scalable, and sustainable solution through a business model. It involves creativity, risk-taking,
                    and a vision to create value. A startup is a newly established venture working to solve a problem
                    through a disruptive approach or technology. It usually operates in an uncertain environment, aiming
                    for rapid growth and innovation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A startup that fascinates me is Zoho, founded by Sridhar Vembu. Unlike typical high-burn startups,
                    Zoho grew profitably and independently, without relying on external investors. Sridhar chose to
                    build his company from a rural village in Tamil Nadu, empowering local talent and creating global
                    products in the SaaS space. His belief in self-reliance and building in Bharat for the world is both
                    inspiring and refreshing in the current startup landscape.

                    The E-Cell at IIT Madras plays a pivotal role in shaping the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the
                    campus. It should be a platform that introduces students to the foundational aspects of
                    entrepreneurshipâ€”problem-solving, critical thinking, and innovation. By organizing engaging events,
                    speaker sessions, and competitions, it should offer students a space to learn, experiment, and grow.
                    From someone who is just curious to someone actively building a startup, E-Cell should provide
                    structured support through mentorship, resources, and exposure. Furthermore, it must also foster a
                    culture of collaboration and initiative, where students are encouraged to pursue bold ideas and take
                    ownership of their learning journey. E-Cell must serve as a launchpad that helps students transform
                    their ideas into tangible impact, both on campus and beyond.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    E-Club is all about helping students, especially freshies, take their first steps into
                    entrepreneurship. It handles events like E-Buddy, Ideastorm, CIC, and Conquer. The team works on
                    event planning, reaching out to speakers, assigning mentors, taking care of logistics, and making
                    sure participants actually enjoy and learn from the events. It also works closely with other
                    verticals for support and smooth execution.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="font-medium text-base mb-2">
                    What do I think are the key learnings from being part of this vertical?
                  </h4>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    We get to learn how to manage events from scratch. Things like planning timelines, handling
                    unexpected problems, talking to different people, and keeping participants engaged all help in
                    building confidence and communication skills. Plus, we also understand how to improve events based
                    on what went wrong last time. It teaches us how to work in a team and take ownership.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="font-medium text-base mb-2">How does a Manager fulfill these responsibilities?</h4>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The Manager is the one who keeps things moving. Whether it's making sure mentors are active,
                    checking that PR is on time, or just handling unexpected changes, the Manager stays involved at
                    every step. They also help the team stay clear on who is doing what and make sure no part of the
                    event is left hanging. Basically, if something doesn't go as planned, the Manager figures out how to
                    fix it.
                  </p>

                  <h4 className="font-medium text-base mb-2">Any new initiative I'd like to take up?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Honestly, the current set of events in E-Club is already really well thought out. Initiatives like
                    E-Buddy and Ideastorm are solid, and E-Soc is a great addition this year. So instead of adding a new
                    event just for the sake of it, I would first make sure the existing events are done properly. That
                    means clear timelines, smooth coordination, and making sure participants get the value they signed
                    up for. Once these are strong, we can always build more on top of them.

                    BuildSchool focuses on technical depth and execution. Both are valuable, but CIC leans more toward
