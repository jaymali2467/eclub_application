                    Startup that fascinates you and why.

                  <p className="mb-2">
                    Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of identifying a real-world
                    problem and developing an innovative, scalable, and
                    sustainable solution through a business model. It involves
                    creativity, risk-taking, and a vision to create value. A
                    startup is a newly established venture working to solve a
                    problem through a disruptive approach or technology. It
                    usually operates in an uncertain environment, aiming for
                    rapid growth and innovation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A startup that fascinates me is Zoho, founded by Sridhar
                    Vembu. Unlike typical high-burn startups, Zoho grew
                    profitably and independently, without relying on external
                    investors. Sridhar chose to build his company from a rural
                    village in Tamil Nadu, empowering local talent and creating
                    global products in the SaaS space. His belief in
                    self-reliance and building in Bharat for the world is both
                    inspiring and refreshing in the current startup landscape.

                    The E-Cell at IIT Madras plays a pivotal role in shaping the
                    entrepreneurial ecosystem within the campus. It should be a
                    platform that introduces students to the foundational
                    aspects of entrepreneurshipâ€”problem-solving, critical
                    thinking, and innovation. By organizing engaging events,
                    speaker sessions, and competitions, it should offer students
                    a space to learn, experiment, and grow. From someone who is
                    just curious to someone actively building a startup, E-Cell
                    should provide structured support through mentorship,
                    resources, and exposure. Furthermore, it must also foster a
                    culture of collaboration and initiative, where students are
                    encouraged to pursue bold ideas and take ownership of their
                    learning journey. E-Cell must serve as a launchpad that
                    helps students transform their ideas into tangible impact,
                    both on campus and beyond.

                    left hanging. Basically, if something doesn't go as planned,
                    the Manager figures out how to fix it.

                    Honestly, the current set of events in E-Club is already
                    really well thought out. Initiatives like E-Buddy and
                    Ideastorm are solid, and E-Soc is a great addition this
                    year. So instead of adding a new event just for the sake of
                    it, I would first make sure the existing events are done
                    properly. That means clear timelines, smooth coordination,
                    and making sure participants get the value they signed up
                    for. Once these are strong, we can always build more on top
                    of them.

                    <li>
                      The goal is to make students hear real stories behind
                      startups â€” not just success but failures, pivots, and
                      decisions.

                    <li>
                      Sessions are informal, interactive, and often end with
                      direct Q&A from the crowd.

                    <li>
                      We usually invite successful founders, funders, or viral

                        <li>
                          Product managers from high-growth companies like Zoho

                      First, build a curated speaker pitch deck â€” a one-pager

                    <li>
                      Outreach should be personalized: referencing a speaker's

                    <li>
                      For hesitancy, show social proof: past event reels,

                    The event can be revamped by introducing a more gamified

                    pitches, or ad design sprints. More hands-on peer mentorship
                    from 2nd-year students and consistent rewards can improve
                    participation. A buddy leaderboard or hostel-wise
                    competition might add excitement. Consistency is key, so
                    mentors need to be briefed well beforehand with a fixed

                      Ethletics was a high-energy, pre-registered event with
                      unique rounds like elevator pitches inside moving
                      vehicles. It tested quick thinking, startup understanding,
                      and creativity under pressure. Despite logistical hurdles
                      like unexpected turnout and tight timing, the event was a
                      crowd favorite. With early planning, this event can be
                      scaled further and even integrated with fun simulations in
                      Summit Streets.

                      Webstart focused on solving startup problems through

                      over 15 teams joined via informal PR. The format was
                      smooth, and participants were highly engaged. With proper
                      mailer outreach and mentor inputs, this can evolve into a
                      flagship design sprint in future editions.

                      up booths and pitch crazy fictional products to crowds.
                      Participants are judged on sales tactics, branding, and
                      crowd interaction. It's fun, spontaneous, and ideal for
                      drawing in passersby at Summit Streets. A good balance of
                      planning and chaos makes it one of the most engaging YC

                      Auction Wars simulates a startup scenario where teams bid

                    Increasing Engagement in Summit Streets
                  </h4>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    To increase engagement, we need to focus on pulling people
                    out of hostels first, not just engaging those already
                    outside. I'd recommend launching pre-Summit hype inside
                    hostels â€” teaser events like mini competitions, meme wars,
                    or short pitch games where winners get direct perks at
                    Summit Streets (free food coupons, YC fast-pass, goodies).
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Once the crowd is there, we can use game-style stalls like
                    spin-the-wheel startup trivia, 2-minute idea pitches, or
                    startup version of beer pong to keep them moving across
                    stalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main challenge is convincing students to show up â€”
                    especially seniors or PGs who often skip E-Summit. To solve
                    this, we can send hostel-wise promo reps + reels from past
                    events + live leaderboard updates with hostel names on the
                    board. Public hype + internal FOMO = more footfall + more
                    fun
